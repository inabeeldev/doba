                            <p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
                            <p>We may collect personally identifiable information from you in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where you are invited to volunteer such information, including, but not limited to, when you register on our site, place an order or subscribe to our newsletter. When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.</p>


                            <p><strong>What do we use your information for?</strong></p>
                            <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience, improve our website, improve customer service, process transactions, send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing, will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. If you decide to opt-in to our mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>


                            <p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
                            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your personal information.</p>
                            <p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>



                            <p><strong>Payments and refunds</strong></p>
                            <p>The Site offers products and services for sale. The Site does not handle payments for these products directly, but rather refers these payments to a secure third-party payment processor which handles all aspects of the payment process. Any payment issues or disputes should be resolved directly with the payment processor. Once we have been notified by the payment processor that a payment has been made, and that the payment has successfully passed a fraud review, access will be granted to the product or service being purchased as soon as possible, however we make no guarantees of timeliness or immediacy. Free accounts are provided with a limited access to the Site that allows the user to test all available services prior to making a payment and determine if the offered services meet userâ€™s needs. You may request a refund within 30 days of the payment only if your browser does not support JavaScript and you're not able to use our privacy policy generator, otherwise no refunds will be offered. Note that our system keeps track of your browser name, version and JavaScript support so we will verify each request for legitimacy.</p>


                            <p><strong>Responsibility of website visitors</strong></p>
                            <p>By operating the Site, Nature Checkout does not represent or imply that it endorses any or all the contributed content, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Site may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Nature Checkout disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Site.</p>


                            <p><strong>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</strong></p>

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
