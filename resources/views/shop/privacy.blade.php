                    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your personal information.</p>
                    <p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

                    <p><strong>Payments and refunds</strong></p>
                    <p>The Site offers products and services for sale. The Site does not handle payments for these products directly, but rather refers these payments to a secure third-party payment processor which handles all aspects of the payment process. Any payment issues or disputes should be resolved directly with the payment processor. Once we have been notified by the payment processor that a payment has been made, and that the payment has successfully passed a fraud review, access will be granted to the product or service being purchased as soon as possible, however we make no guarantees of timeliness or immediacy. Free accounts are provided with a limited access to the Site that allows the user to test all available services prior to making a payment and determine if the offered services meet userâ€™s needs. You may request a refund within 30 days of the payment only if your browser does not support JavaScript and you're not able to use our privacy policy generator, otherwise no refunds will be offered. Note that our system keeps track of your browser name, version and JavaScript support so we will verify each request for legitimacy.</p>
